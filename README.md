# Restaurant Billing System

This is my first GUI project using python tkinter which displays menu of hotel, takes order from customer and generates bill.

User enters customer details and selects item from menu.
Menu can be displayed either category wise or full at once.

Selected item will be displayed in item frame from where User can add item, remove item or update quantity.
Changes will be displayed in Order list in order frame.

User can generate bill after selecting at least 1 item.
Order cancellation is also provided.

When Generate bill is clicked, Bill will be displayed in new window to the user and will be saved in 'Bill Records' folder.

Python Dictionary is used to store(Temporary Storage) customer's order and text file are used to store(Permanent Storage) menu and bills with customers information.

Menu is present in text files in 'Menu' folder and bills will be saved in text format in 'Bill Records' folder.

The interface of the application is shown below :-
